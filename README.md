## features

* **hella good plugin system**: the only required plugin is the plugin manager.
  You can disable everything else and the editor won't be able to do anything.
  That would be stupid.
* **extensible with [gluon](https://github.com/gluon-lang/gluon)**: Configuration is code.
* **killer color schemes**: They adjust as you type. Jam out.
* **kickass bindings**: Break out of your shell. Bindings can be arbitrary
  state machines.

## y tho

byt is a flexibly ergonomic text editor for the terminal. Its primary goals are
efficiency and extensibility. It renders in full true color on supported
terminals and has a goal of being a command-line editor for the modern age.

What does that mean? You might feel that `vim` and `emacs` have the market
cornered on command-line editors. As someone who is a dedicated `vim` user, I
will be the first one to tell you its fatal flaw: bindings are only additive.
You cannot replace them. The basic movement keys cannot be changed or moved to
other keys. In addition, plugins have to do hacky work with text buffers to
make interfaces.

## install it

The editor is very much a work in progress and currently is not even close to
being functional. See ROADMAP.md for a deeper understanding of where things are
and when, if at all, byt will be usable for general text editing. You probably
won't see it at your average coffee shop for a number of years.
